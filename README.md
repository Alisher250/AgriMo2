AgriMo - AgriMo is a multipurpose system that combines real-time analytics, weather stations, and artificial intelligence to optimize agricultural activities.
The study's objective is to create an AgriMo system that uses artificial intelligence, weather stations, sensors, a platform, and software for drones to optimize fundamental agricultural processes, boost yields, improve resistance to climate change, and boost the economic effectiveness of agricultural production.
It has been hypothesized that the use of the AgriMo system will improve the effectiveness of agricultural processes, increase yields, and increase economic benefits by addressing issues with soil degradation, water scarcity, climate change, the spread of diseases in the crop, and the lack of specialists
Stages and procedure of research: 
Agricultural organizations and farmers were surveyed, existing data sets were analyzed, a model for machine learning was developed, a website for a weather station was made, and both the website and the weather station were tested.
Experimental technique:
putting together and programming a weather station, website, database, deep learning, and computer vision models.
Experimenting using a weather station, a website, and artificial intelligence models to enhance the precision of engineering solutions and plans.
The novelty of the research and the degree of independence:
The system's accessibility, integrated artificial intelligence, computer vision for drones, and the platform's communication features between farmers and specialists are our primary values and benefits, according to a thorough competitive analysis.
Areas of practical use of the results:
Use of the AgriMo system by state-owned corporations in the agro-industry, medium-sized and big agricultural enterprises, as well as by individual and group farmers.
Deep study led to the development of an artificial intelligence and computer vision-based intelligent system for the efficient and practical management of agricultural land. The findings demonstrated that although losses are minimal, deep learning models' accuracy is rather good.
